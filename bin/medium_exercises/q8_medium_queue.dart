// Explain priority queues and their applications.

//A priority queue is a specialized data structure that operates similarly to a regular queue, but with an added feature:
// each element in the queue has a priority associated with it. The priority determines the order in which elements are dequeued.
// In a priority queue, elements with higher priority are dequeued before elements with lower priority, regardless of the order in which they were added.
//
// Priority queues can be implemented using different underlying data structures, such as heaps (binary heap being the most common), arrays, or linked lists.
// The most common operation on a priority queue is:
//
// Insert (enqueue): Adds an element with a specific priority to the queue.
// Extract (dequeue): Removes and returns the element with the highest priority.
// In a max-priority queue, the element with the highest priority is dequeued first, whereas in a min-priority queue,
// the element with the lowest priority is dequeued first.
// 
// Applications of Priority Queues:
// Scheduling Tasks: Priority queues are often used in scheduling algorithms.
// For example, in operating systems, a task scheduler may use a priority queue to determine which process to execute next.
// Processes with higher priorities will be executed first.
//
// Dijkstra’s Algorithm: In shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra’s, a priority queue is used to select the next node to explore based on the shortest distance.
// Nodes with the smallest distance (highest priority) are processed first.
//
// Huffman Coding: Huffman coding, used in data compression algorithms, relies on a priority queue to build the optimal prefix tree.
// The characters with the least frequency are assigned higher priority, while characters with more frequent occurrences are assigned lower priority.
//
// A Algorithm:* Similar to Dijkstra's, the A* algorithm for pathfinding also uses a priority queue to manage open nodes.
// Nodes are prioritized based on the estimated cost to reach the destination.
//
// Event-driven Simulation: In simulations, events are scheduled to occur at specific times.
// Priority queues are used to manage events so that the event with the earliest time is processed first.
//
// Merge Sorted Files: When merging multiple sorted files, a priority queue can efficiently track the smallest element from each file,
// allowing the merging process to proceed in an optimal manner.
//
// Network Traffic Management: Priority queues can be used in networking protocols to prioritize certain types of traffic,
// such as voice or video data, over regular data traffic, ensuring that time-sensitive information is transmitted first.
